.SYNOPSIS
    Publishes the Fast JXR HDR codec plugin and packs it as fast-jxr-hdr_<arch>.igplugin.zip.

.DESCRIPTION
    Produces a single "Plugin_FastJxrHdrCodec" folder
    holding the native library and its manifest. ImageGlass accepts that either through
    Settings > Plugins > Add or as a manual copy into the _plugins directory.

.PARAMETER Rid
    Which runtimes to build. Defaults to both Windows architectures.

.PARAMETER Deploy
    Also copy the staged folder into %LOCALAPPDATA%\ImageGlass\_plugins for local testing.
    Requires exactly one -Rid. Close ImageGlass first: a loaded plugin's DLL is locked.
